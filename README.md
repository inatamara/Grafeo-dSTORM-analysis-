Grafeo is Matlab based program for the analysis of a single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data e.g. dSTORM or PALM. It works on a single molecule coordinates rather than pixelated images. Grafeo uses various pointillist approaches previously described in the literature, e.g. Voronoi Tessellation, Delaunay Triangulation, Ripleyâ€™s function. Grafeo does not pretend to be the first to apply these functions for the single-molecule data. It was developed to cope with a huge amount of data to work in the batch processing mode. Grafeo was published in Haas et al., 'Single-molecule localization microscopy reveals molecular transactions during RAD51 filament assembly at cellular DNA damage sites',  Nucleic Acids Research, 2018,gkx1303, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1303 Grafeo v1beta . Grafeo is constantly updated. The current Grafeo version is Grafeo v2. It has new functionalities, developed for an articles:  Haas et al., 'Pectin homogalacturonan nanofilament expansion drives morphogenesis in plant epidermal cells' currently under review. All the remaining errors and inconsistencies will be corrected in future releases.  If you have any questions, please contact the author via email: inakuflers@wp.pl or Twitter @KalinaHaas.
