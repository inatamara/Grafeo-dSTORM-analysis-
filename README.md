Grafeo is Matlab based program for the analysis of a single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data e.g. dSTORM or PALM. It works on a single molecule coordinates rather than pixelated images. Grafeo uses various pointillist approaches previously described in the literature, e.g. Voronoi Tessellation, Delaunay Triangulation, Ripleyâ€™s function. Its first version (Grafeo 1.2beta) was published Grafeo was published in Haas et al., 'Single-molecule localization microscopy reveals molecular transactions during RAD51 filament assembly at cellular DNA damage sites',  Nucleic Acids Research, 2018,gkx1303, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1303 
The latest version of the Grafeo is Grafeo v2, which contains some new functionalities; some of them developed for article 'Nanoscopy reveals pectin
filaments and their role in plant epidermal morphogenesis' currently under review. If you have any questions please contact the author via email: inakuflers@wp.pl or Twitter @KalinaHaas.
